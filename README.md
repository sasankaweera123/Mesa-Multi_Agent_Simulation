# Multi Agent Simulation

![](https://github.com/sasankaweera123/Mesa-Multi_Agent_Simulation/blob/main/IMG/gif/gameovergif.gif)

Game Mode is the game design using multi agent simulation theory. <br><br> [![oython](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py)](https://skillicons.dev)

# Info

In this development we used python as the programming Language to develop the Game Mode. [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Library has been used for the multi agent simulation section.<br><br>

Game Mode defult port will be `8521`

Randomly create Agent Steps and move then also according to Random.<br>
If the Agent comes to the same location below condition will be perform 
- Power Up agent get 1 point and Power Low agent lose 1 point.
- Same Power Agent lose 1 point each.
- If the Power = 0 Agent will die.

In the Game there are two parameters users can control
- Frame Rate

- Agent Number (After Changing the agent number need to click reset button to update)

# Packages

- [Mesa](https://pypi.org/project/Mesa/) : It allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Pythonâ€™s data analysis tools. Its goal is to be the Python 3-based alternative to NetLogo, Repast, or MASON.
